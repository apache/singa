# Singa for Readmission Prediction

## Readmission Prediction Task

Readmission prediction is an important tool that uses data science and machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of a patient being readmitted after discharge. The core goal of this technology is to identify risk factors for readmission by analyzing multiple data such as a patientâ€™s medical history, physiological indicators, diagnostic information, treatment options, and socioeconomic factors, and to take appropriate interventions in advance to reduce this risk.

The dataset used in this task is MIMIC-III after preprocessed. The features are data containing 6 visit windows, with 546 frequent diagnoses, procedures and drugs for each window. Each item in features are data for one patient, and these features are encoded by one-hot code. The labels are corresponding flags to mark whether the patient was readmitted within 30 days, where the label equals "1" if the patient was readmiited within 30 days, the label equals "0" if not.


## Structure

* `data` includes the load of mimic-iii data to be utilized.

* `model` includes the MLP model construction codes by creating
  a subclass of `Module` to wrap the neural network operations 
  of each model.

* `train_mimic_mlp.py` is the training script, which controls the training flow by
  doing BackPropagation and SGD update.

## Command
```bash
python train_mimic_mlp.py mlp mimic-iii -dir pathToDataset
```
